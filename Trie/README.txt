Final nodes in timed graphs have been colored accordingly to the resulting failed path:
     green : no failures, the system is in nominal conditions
     red : uas.uav\_engage.failure (red events)
     blue : uas.pic\_engage.failure (blue events)
     purple : uas.transmit.failure (purple events)
     violet : uas.pic\_engage.failure (violet events) or/and uas.transmit.failure (violet events)
